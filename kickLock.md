The kicklock restricts the rotation of the rear wheel to prevent the bike from being riden. It also arms to alarm of the smart cartridge in the even of movement.

Inside there is an electromagnetic coil. When energized, it retracts the shaft, and repels the slug. This allows the pin to retract and the kick lock lug to be disengaged.

When the kick lock lug is disengaged, it pushes against a pin, which pushes a momentary switch closed.
